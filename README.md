<h3 align="center">A full featured application to better save contacts</h3>

<br>

## Start this program locally

- Git clone the project on your local computer: `git clone git@github.com:leonardogavaudan/db-friends.git`
- Go into the cloned repository: `cd db-friends`
- Install the necessary node modules: `yarn install` (this assumes node and npm are both installed)
- Start up the application: `yarn start:dev`
- Your terminal will indicate which port the application started on (usually `localhost:3000`)

## How the application works

I. The home page is where all your supposed on contacts will show up, when you first start the app, this will be empty given that I'm using an in-memory database.

II. Go the + page in the nav bar in order to create a new profile

III. Come back to the home page, and witness beauty

IV. That is all for now, will be adding more features
